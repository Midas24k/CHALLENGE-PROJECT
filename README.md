# challenge-project-

Welcome to the week 1 challenge a project based on HTGML, Github, and CSS. It was a riveting experience that left the mind wondering, "Why did I take this long to start coding".

# What was your motivation?
The motivation behind this project stemmed from the desire to learn and practice. It was assigned, it was written, it was finished so that it could be graded

# Why did you build this project?
I built this project because it was a great way to test skills taught in class with practical real-life scenarios 

# What problem does it solve?
This project was a good knowledge check as well as a teacher for what's to come. I have experienced many study points outside of what the class taught in week 1.

# What did you learn?
I learned that I love to code and problem-solve. WHY DID IT TAKE SO LONG FOR ME TO PICK THIS UP?
